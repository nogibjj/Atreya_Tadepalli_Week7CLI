## Purpose:

* In this project, I have forked my previous project involving advanced SQL operations, and have incorporated instructions regarding command line usage so that I can call the requested method directly using the command line within the terminal.

## Requirements:

* I maintained the same requirements as those utililzed in the advanced SQL Project.

## Data:

* All operations executed pertain to just one database - the MLB dataset which involves a team, its wins, losses, win-loss percentage, games back (of the division leader), and year.

## Results

* CRUD Operations
